# Gmail API Integration Research Findings

## Overview
The Gmail API is a RESTful API that provides access to Gmail mailboxes and allows sending mail. It's suitable for various applications including:
- Read-only mail extraction, indexing, and backup
- Automated or programmatic message sending
- Email organization including filtering and sorting of messages

## Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 is required for Gmail API authentication
- Server-side flow is recommended for web applications
- Need to create a Google Cloud project and enable the Gmail API
- Must configure OAuth consent screen and create OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Client ID and client secret are required for authentication

## Required Scopes
For our email management agent, we'll need the following scopes:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` - To read emails and metadata
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` - For marking emails as read/unread
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels` - For categorization using labels

## Python Client Library
- Google provides official Python client libraries for Gmail API
- Installation: `pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`
- The library handles authentication flow and API requests
- Sample code available in the Python quickstart guide

## Best Practices
- Use batch requests when making multiple API calls to improve performance
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Store authentication tokens securely
- Use the most narrowly focused scopes possible
- Follow security best practices for handling user data

## Implementation Considerations
- Need to handle OAuth 2.0 flow in a web application
- Store refresh tokens securely for continuous access
- Implement rate limiting to avoid hitting API quotas
- Consider caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
- Ensure proper error handling for API failures
