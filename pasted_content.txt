Build an autonomous AI agent that connects to my email inbox and performs the following tasks:

Email Retrieval & Categorization:

Automatically fetch all incoming emails from the inbox.

Analyze the content of each email and determine its priority level (e.g., high, medium, low) based on keywords, sender importance, urgency, or calendar mentions.

Summarization:

Provide a short, human-readable summary of each email so that I can understand the context at a glance.

Action Suggestions & Scheduling:

Detect if the email contains meeting invitations, deadlines, or appointments.

If so, propose a corresponding calendar event (with title, date/time, and participants).

Inbox Digest Report:

Generate a daily or hourly digest listing:

Top 5 most important emails (with summaries).

Any proposed calendar entries.

Unread emails that might require immediate attention.

User Interface:

Present results in a chat-like interface or a simple dashboard.

Allow me to accept, ignore, or reply to messages directly from the summary.

Optional Ideas to Improve:

Automatically group similar emails (e.g., newsletters, reports, reminders).

Suggest draft replies for common messages (e.g., meeting confirmations, thank-you notes).

Detect spam or irrelevant content and filter it out automatically.
